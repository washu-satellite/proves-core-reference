Manager for Payload Communiction

Scope: this component is camera-specific — it acknowledges every received buffer with the Nicla `<MOISES>` token (`PayloadCom.cpp` `sendAck`) — and is not a generic payload transport; a payload that speaks its own framed protocol wires its handler directly to a `ZephyrUartDriver` instead (see `Components/DriverBoardHandler` for the direct-driver pattern).

## Usage Examples
See CameraManager Component for how to use this!

### Typical Usage
Configure the PayloadCom component to a uart port to allow for sending and receiving messages.

## Port Descriptions
| Name | Description |
|---|---|
|uartForward|Send a messaged over the UART driver|
|bufferReturn|Return buffer to the UART driver so it can be deallocated|
|commandIn|Port from the connected payload handler to receive commands and forward them over UART|
|uartDataIn|Port for receiving data from the UART driver|
|uartDataOut|Port for forwarding received messages to the connected payload handler|


## Events
| Name | Description |
|---|---|
|CommandForwardError|Component failed to send a message over UART|
|CommandForwardSuccess|Component successfully sent a message over UART|
|UartReceived|Component received UART data|
|AckSent|Component Sent Acknowledgement (Used for message protocols)|
