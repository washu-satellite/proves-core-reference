# Components::Watchdog Component

## 1. Introduction

The `Components::Watchdog` component provides the mechanism to "pet" the physical watchdog circuit on the PROVES FC Board and provides a visual indicator by blinking an LED at a fixed interval. The component is driven by a rate group and oscillates the watchdog GPIO every rategroup tick.

## 2. Requirements

The requirements for `Components::Watchdog` are as follows:

Requirement | Description | Verification Method | Verified?
----------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ---------
WD-001 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall activate upon startup. | Inspection | Yes
WD-002 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall oscillate the watchdog GPIO pin (24) on/off on each rategroup tick. | Inspection | Yes
WD-003 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall provide telemetry for watchdog transition count. | Integration Test | Yes
WD-004 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall respond to stop signals to halt the watchdog. | Integration Test | Yes
WD-005 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall provide a test command to stop the watchdog. | Integration Test | Yes
WD-006 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall emit an event when the watchdog stops. | Integration Test | Yes
WD-007 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall provide a test command to start the watchdog. | Integration Test | Yes
WD-008 | The `Components::Watchdog` component shall emit an event when the watchdog starts. | Integration Test | Yes

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Context

#### 3.1.1 Component Diagram

The `Components::Watchdog` component has the following component diagram:

#### 3.1.2 Ports

Port Data Type | Name | Direction | Kind | Usage
-------------- | ---- | --------- | ---- | -----
[`Svc::Sched`]| run | Input | Synchronous | Receive periodic calls from rate group
[`Fw::Signal`]| start | Input | Synchronous | Receive start signal to start watchdog
[`Fw::Signal`]| stop | Input | Synchronous | Receive stop signal to stop watchdog
[`Drv::GpioWrite`]| gpioSet | Output | n/a | Control GPIO state through driver
[`Fw::Signal`]| prepareForReboot | Output | n/a | Notify ModeManager of an intentional reboot
[`Components::FaultReport`]| faultOut | Output | n/a | Report that petting has stopped to the FaultManager

##### Fault reporting

At the end of `stop_handler`, the stop is reported to `faultManager.faultIn` as
`WATCHDOG_STOPPED`, carrying the transition count as its value. The report is purely
observational: the FaultManager's disposition is ignored and its policy for this type is "no
action", because by the time this fires the hardware reset (about 26 s later) is already under way
and there is nothing left to decide. An unconnected `faultOut` is never called. See
`Components/FaultManager/docs/sdd.md`.

#### 3.1.3 Commands

Name | Kind | Description
---- | ---- | -----
START_WATCHDOG | Synchronous | calls the port `start_runhandler` to start the watchdog.
STOP_WATCHDOG | Synchronous | calls the port `stop_runhandler` to stop the watchdog.

#### 3.1.4 Events

Name | Description
---- | -----
WatchdogStart | Emits once the watchdog has started.
WatchdogStop | Emits once the watchdog has stopped.

#### 3.1.5 Telemetry

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----
WatchdogTransitions | U32 | Number of times the GPIO has oscillated from on/off during watchdog petting

## 4. Change Log

| Date | Description |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-05 | Added `faultOut`: stopping the watchdog is reported to the FaultManager. Observation only; the reboot remains the hardware watchdog's (FaultManager-6). |
