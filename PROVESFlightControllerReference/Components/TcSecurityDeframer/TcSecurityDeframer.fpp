        ### Commands ###

        @ Command to get the current sequence number
        sync command GET_SEQ_NUM()

        @ Command to set the current sequence number
        sync command SET_SEQ_NUM(seq_num: U32)

        ### Telemetry ###

        @ Telemetry for the current sequence number, updated on each successfully authenticated packet
        telemetry CurrentSequenceNumber : U32

        ### Events ###

        @ SequenceNumberGet returns the current sequence number from the file system in response to a command
        event SequenceNumberGet(seq_num: U32) severity activity high id 6 format "Sequence number is {}"

        @SequenceNumberReadFailed indicates that there was an error reading the sequence number from the file system
        event SequenceNumberReadFailed(status: Os.FileStatus) severity warning high id 14 format "Failed to read sequence number, error: {}" throttle 2

        @ SequenceNumberSet indicates that the sequence number was set to a specified value through a command
        event SequenceNumberSet(seq_num: U32) severity activity high id 7 format "Sequence number set to {}"

        @ SequenceNumberWriteFailed indicates that there was an error writing the sequence number to file
        event SequenceNumberWriteFailed(status: Os.FileStatus) severity warning high id 8 format "Failed to write sequence number, error: {}" throttle 2

        @ SequenceNumberInvalid indicates that a received packet had a sequence number that was outside of the acceptable window
        event SequenceNumberInvalid(packet_seq_num: U32, seq_num: U32, window: U32) severity warning high id 2 format "Sequence number less than last accepted or out of window: Received={}, LastAccepted={}, Window={}" throttle 2

        @ AuthenticationFailed indicates that a received packet failed authentication
        event AuthenticationFailed(auth_status: PacketAuthenticatorStatus, rc: I32) severity warning high id 1 format "Authentication failed: Status={}, PSA Return Code={}" throttle 2

        @ ParsingFailed indicates that there was an error parsing a received packet
        event ParsingFailed(parse_status: PacketParserStatus) severity warning high id 3 format "Parsing failed: {}" throttle 2

        @ SpiInvalid indicates that a received packet had an invalid SPI value
        event SpiInvalid(packet_spi: U32) severity warning high id 4 format "SPI invalid: Received={}" throttle 2

        ### Parameters ###

        @ Parameter for the sequence numbers window size, used to prevent replay attacks. The window allows no reuse of previous sequence numbers but allows for new sequence numbers to be accepted within the window size
        param SEQ_NUM_WINDOW : U32 default 50000

        @ Parameter for the file path where the current sequence number is stored
        param SEQ_NUM_FILE_PATH : string default "//sequence_number.txt"

        ### Ports ###

        @ Port receiving frames from TcDeframer: [Security Header | Data Field | Security Trailer]
        guarded input port dataIn: Svc.ComDataWithContext

        @ Port forwarding the Data Field to SpacePacketDeframer with the authenticated flag set in the context
        output port dataOut: Svc.ComDataWithContext

        @ Port returning ownership of structurally invalid frames back to TcDeframer
        output port dataReturnOut: Svc.ComDataWithContext

        @ Port receiving back ownership of buffers sent on dataOut
        sync input port dataReturnIn: Svc.ComDataWithContext
