# Components::Authenticate

The Authenticate component verifies the integrity and authenticity of CCSDS command packets using HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) in accordance with CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol, CCSDS 355.0-B-2 (July 2022). It adds a parameter on the config that goes with every packet that says whether or not the component is authenticated.

## Overview

The Authenticate component sits in the uplink communications path between the `TcDeframer` and `SpacePacketDeframer` components. It adds a authenticated tag to the config of each packet before they are deframed and routed to the command dispatcher.  The component implements security features including:

- HMAC-based authentication per CCSDS 355.0-B-2
- Security Association (SA) management with SPI-based key selection
- Sequence number validation and anti-replay protection

Connections:
TcDeFramer.dataOut -> Authenticate.dataIn
Authenticate->dataOut -> SpacePacketDeframer
Authenticate->dataReturnOut -> TcDeframer.dataReturnIn
SpacePacketDeframer.dataReturnOut -> Authenticate.dataReturnIn

Authenticate is positioned before SpacePacketDeframer because CCSDS 355.0-B-2 specifies HMAC computation over the actual frame header bytes, which requires the header to be present

## Packet Format

### CCSDS Protocol Stack Context

The security protocol operates at the Space Packet level per CCSDS 355.0-B-2. The security headers and trailers are embedded within the Space Packet Data Field, which is itself in a TC Transfer Frame. The complete protocol stack is:

1.

First the TC Transfer Frame is removed by TcDeframer
[TC Header 5B] [Data Field] [TC Trailer 2B]


2.
THIS IS WHAT GOES THROUGH AUTHENTICATE

Now the Security Header and Security Trailer must be inside the data field, as specified by CCSDS 355.0-B-2

Space Packet (received by Authenticate)
[Security Header 8B]
[Space Packet Primary Header 6B]
   [Space Packet Data Field]
      [F Prime Command Packet]
[Security Trailer 8B]

The output from Authenticate:

Space Packet
   [Space Packet Primary Header 6B]
      [Space Packet Data Field]
         [F Prime Command Packet]

**Total packet structure:**
Security Header: of 6 octets in length (TM Baseline)

(SPI (2 octets + Sequence Number 4 octets))

- Space Packet Primary Header: 6 bytes
- Space Packet Data Field: 16 + command size bytes
  - F Prime Command Packet: Variable (up to 225 bytes)
- Security Trailer: 8 bytes (HMAC)

Packets NOT requiring authentication are forwarded unchanged to `dataOut. Later we have to get the FPrime router to route radio packets based on the authenticated tag on the config

### HMAC Computation

The HMAC is computed over the following fields in order (per CCSDS 355.0-B-2 section 2.3.2.3.1):
1. **Security Header**: SPI (2 bytes) + Sequence Number (4 bytes) + Reserved (2 bytes) = 6 bytes
2. **Frame Data Field**: The F Prime command packet payload (bytes 22-N)

**Key Selection**: The secret key is selected based on the SPI value from the security header. Each SPI maps to a Security Association containing:
- A secret key (shared with ground station)
- Current sequence number
- Sequence number window size
- APID that you can validate

### Sequence Number Validation

- The component shall compare the received sequence number against the stored sequence number for the SA identified by SPI
- If the received sequence number is greater than the stored value (and within the sequence number window), the component shall update the stored sequence number
- If the received sequence number differs from the expected value by more than the sequence number window, the packet shall be rejected
- Sequence number rollover (from 0xFFFFFFFF to 0x00000000) shall be handled correctly

## Parameters
name | type | use
--- | ------| ----
SEQ_NUM_WINDOW | U32 | default 50, how far from the hmac code number we can get

### GDS Plugin

In order to send commands to the satellite and test this component we also need a GDS plugin. The plugins are in the Framing Folder, specifically in the authenticate_plugin.py file.

You can make it by running

> make framer-plugin

and run it by running

> make gds-with-framer

#### Configuring Plugin Parameters

The authentication plugin supports several configurable parameters that can be set via command-line arguments when running `fprime-gds`. These parameters control the authentication behavior on the ground station side to match the flight software configuration.

**Available Parameters:**

| Parameter | CLI Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|--------------|------|---------|-------------|
| Initial Sequence Number | `--initial-sequence-number` | int | 0 | Starting sequence number for authentication packets |
| SPI | `--spi` | int | 1 | Security Parameter Index used to identify the Security Association |
| Window Size | `--window-size` | int | 50 | Sequence number window size for anti-replay protection |
| Authentication Type | `--authentication-type` | string | "HMAC" | Type of authentication algorithm (currently supports HMAC) |
| Authentication Key | `--authentication-key` | string | "0x65b32a18e0c63a347b56e8ae6c51358a" | Secret key as hex string with 0x prefix (must match flight software) |

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Use all default values
fprime-gds --framing authenticate-space-data-link

# Set a custom initial sequence number
fprime-gds --framing authenticate-space-data-link --initial-sequence-number 100

# Set multiple parameters
fprime-gds --framing authenticate-space-data-link \
  --spi 5 \
  --initial-sequence-number 1000 \
  --window-size 100 \
  --authentication-key "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"

# Configure all parameters
fprime-gds --framing authenticate-space-data-link \
  --spi 10 \
  --initial-sequence-number 5000 \
  --window-size 200 \
  --authentication-type "HMAC" \
  --authentication-key "0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
```

**Important Notes:**

- The `--authentication-key` must match the key configured in the flight software's SPI dictionary (`spi_dict.txt`) for the corresponding SPI value
- The `--initial-sequence-number` should be synchronized with the flight software's current sequence number to avoid authentication failures
- The `--window-size` should match the `SEQ_NUM_WINDOW` parameter configured in the flight software
- All parameters are optional and will use their defaults if not specified
- To view all available arguments, run: `fprime-gds --help`

### Uploads to run this code

To run the SPI selection (otherwise the encryption will be the default encryption), you should Uplink the spi_dict.txt file in the AuthenticateFiles folder

|AUTH013|The anti-replay sequence number shall be persisted as a PersistedRecord (magic, version, CRC) updated atomically; a corrupt or truncated file shall be detected, emit a warning event, and fall back to the first-boot baseline (sequence number 0) rather than silently adopting a corrupted value|Unit Test|Unit|For every single-byte corruption and every truncation of the sequence file: exactly one warning event and the replay window baseline is 0; a valid file round-trips the stored sequence number|||

## Unit Tests


## Generating Keys

> make generate-spi-dict

will create spi_dict.txt in the UploadsFilesystem folder

> make build

will take the first key in spi_dict and write it to AuthDefaultKey.h. This is read by the file at runtime embedded in the code as a default key, so that each build will take the default key. This file is in the .gitignore so it is generated by the machine.

By default, the plugin also reads the first line in the spi_dict file, but you can change that parameter if you want to change the spi index

## Plugin

To Run the Plugin, first activate the fprime-venv

to build the framer plugin

> make framer-plugin

and to start the gds with the

> make gds-with-framer
