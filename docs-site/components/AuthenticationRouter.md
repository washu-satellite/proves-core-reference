# Svc::AuthenticationRouter

The `Svc::AuthenticationRouter` component routes F´ packets (such as command or file packets) to other components. It is based on the FPrime Router, explained and linked later in the sdd, with two exceptions

1. Command Loss Time component, which checks how long since commands have last been routed through the satellite. If it has been too long (changeable parameter) it will emit an event and send out to safemode, to conserve power
As a result of this component writing to the filesystem, this component is active, while the usual FprimeRouter is passive.

2. This component handles authenticated packets. It will check a list of preconfigured opcodes that do not need to be authenticated, will pass those on as well as the things that are authenticated

The `Svc::AuthenticationRouter` component receives F´ packets (as Fw::Buffer objects) and routes them to other components through synchronous port calls. The input port of type `Svc.ComDataWithContext` passes this Fw.Buffer object along with optional context data which can help for routing. The current F Prime protocol does not use this context data, but is nevertheless present in the interface for compatibility with other protocols which may for example pass APIDs in the frame headers.

The `Svc::AuthenticationRouter` component supports `Fw::ComPacketType::FW_PACKET_COMMAND` and `Fw::ComPacketType::FW_PACKET_FILE` packet types. Unknown packet types are forwarded on the `unknownDataOut` port, which a project-specific component can connect to for custom routing.

About memory management, all buffers sent by `Svc::AuthenticationRouter` on the `fileOut` and `unknownDataOut` ports are expected to be returned to the router through the `fileBufferReturnIn` port for deallocation.

## Custom Routing

The `Svc::AuthenticationRouter` component is designed to be extensible through the use of a project-specific router. The `unknownDataOut` port can be connected to a project-specific component that can receive all unknown packet types. This component can then implement custom handling of these unknown packets. After processing, the project-specific component shall return the received buffer to the `Svc::AuthenticationRouter` component through the `fileBufferReturnIn` port (named this way as it only receives file packets in the common use-case), which will deallocate the buffer.

## Usage Examples

The `Svc::FprimeRouter` component is used in the uplink stack of many reference F´ application such as [the tutorials source code](https://github.com/fprime-community#tutorials).

### Typical Usage

In the canonical uplink communications stack, `Svc::FprimeRouter` is connected to Svc::CmdDispatcher and Svc::FileUplink components, to receive Command and File packets respectively. See the [F Prime documentation](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/) for more details on these components.

## Port Descriptions

| Kind | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `async input` | `schedIn` | `Svc.Sched` | Port receiving calls from the rate group for periodic command loss time checking |
| `async input` | `dataIn` | `Svc.ComDataWithContext` | Receiving Fw::Buffer with context buffer from Deframer |
| `output` | `dataReturnOut` | `Svc.ComDataWithContext` | Returning ownership of buffer received on `dataIn` |
| `output` | `commandOut` | `Fw.Com` | Port for sending command packets as Fw::ComBuffers |
| `output` | `fileOut` | `Fw.BufferSend` | Port for sending file packets as Fw::Buffer (ownership passed to receiver) |
| `sync input` | `fileBufferReturnIn` | `Fw.BufferSend` | Receiving back ownership of buffer sent on `fileOut` and `unknownDataOut` |
| `sync input` | `cmdResponseIn` | `Fw.CmdResponse` | Port for receiving command responses from a command dispatcher (can be a no-op) |
| `output` | `unknownDataOut` | `Svc.ComDataWithContext` | Port forwarding unknown data (useful for adding custom routing rules with a project-defined router) |
| `output` | `bufferAllocate` | `Fw.BufferGet` | Port for allocating buffers, allowing copy of received data |
| `output` | `bufferDeallocate` | `Fw.BufferSend` | Port for deallocating buffers |
| `output` | `SafeModeOn` | `Fw.Signal` | Port for sending signal to safemode when command loss time expires |
| `output` | `faultOut` | `Components.FaultReport` | Port reporting command loss to the FaultManager |

### Fault reporting

At the top of `CallSafeMode`, the command loss is reported to `faultManager.faultIn` as
`COMMAND_LOSS`. The port's return value is a disposition:

* `OBSERVED` — the FaultManager only counted the report, so this component performs its own
  recovery exactly as it always has: `reset_watchdog` (which stops the watchdog) and then
  `SetSafeMode(EXTERNAL_REQUEST)`. This is the shipped configuration, because the FaultManager ships
  in shadow mode (`AUTHORITY_ENABLED` false).
* `CLAIMED` — the FaultManager holds authority for `COMMAND_LOSS` and performs the same two calls
  itself, on the same ports, in the same order, with the same reason.

The command-loss bookkeeping (`update_command_loss_start(true)` and the once-per-boot
`m_safeModeCalled` latch) runs either way. An unconnected `faultOut` is treated as `OBSERVED`. See
`Components/FaultManager/docs/sdd.md`.

| BypassAuthentification | Activity Low | bypassed: Fw.Bool | Emitted to indicate whether authentication was bypassed. Format: "BypassAuthentification: {}" |


## Telemetry Channels

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| LastCommandPacketTime | U64 | The time of the last command packet |
| CommandLossSafeOn | bool | The status of the command loss time sending to safe mode |
| ByPassedRouter | U64 | Number of Packets that have bypassed the router |
| PassedRouter | U64 | Number of Packets that have passed the router |

## Change Log

| Date | Description |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-05 | Added `faultOut`: command loss is reported to the FaultManager. A `CLAIMED` disposition hands the watchdog stop and the safe mode entry to that component; `OBSERVED` (the shipped configuration, and the behaviour when the port is unconnected) leaves this component's own recovery untouched. |
