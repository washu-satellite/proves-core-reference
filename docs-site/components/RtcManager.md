# Components::RtcManager

The RTC Manager component interfaces with the Real Time Clock (RTC) to provide time measurements. When the RTC is unavailable, the component automatically fails over to monotonic uptime to ensure continuous system operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code executed by the RTC Manager’s `timeGetPort` must never call into the eventing system. The timeGetPort is invoked frequently across F Prime and is used by the eventing system itself, any handler code must not use event ports, commands, or telemetry — doing so can cause deadlocks. Log any errors from the `timeGetPort` handler to the console with throttling to prevent flooding and do not allow those errors to cause the handler to fail. If the RTC is unavailable or an error occurs while retrieving time, the component must gracefully fall back to returning a monotonic uptime.

### Typical Usage

#### `TIME_SET` Command Usage
1. The component is instantiated and initialized during system startup
2. A ground station sends a `TIME_SET` command with the desired time
3. On each command, the component:
    - Cancels any running sequences
    - Validates the time data (year >= 1900, month [1-12], day [1-31], hour [0-23], minute [0-59], second [0-59])
    - Emits validation failure events if any field is invalid
    - Sets the time on the RTC if validation passes
    - Emits a `TimeSet` event with the previous time if the time is set successfully
    - Emits a `TimeNotSet` event if the time is not set successfully
    - Emits a `DeviceNotReady` event if the device is not ready

#### `TIMEBASE` Parameter Usage
1. A ground station sends `TIMEBASE_PRM_SET` with `TB_PROC_TIME` or `TB_SC_TIME`, and `TIMEBASE_PRM_SAVE` to persist the choice across boots
2. When the parameter is updated the component:
    - Cancels any running sequences, since the change in reported time may affect them
    - Emits a `TimeBaseChanged` event with the timebase now in use
3. On each `timeGetPort` call, if the parameter is `TB_PROC_TIME` the component returns uptime without touching the RTC

The parameter uses `Rtc.TimeBase`, a component-local copy of the upstream F Prime `TimeBase` enum carrying only the bases this component can source (`TB_PROC_TIME` and `TB_SC_TIME`). It lives in its own `Rtc` module because a `Drv.TimeBase` would shadow the global `TimeBase` enum inside generated `Drv` code. The default is `TB_SC_TIME`.

#### `ALARM_SET` Command Usage
1. The component is instantiated and initialized during system startup
2. A ground station sends a `ALARM_SET` command with the desired time
3. On each command, the component:
    - Validates that the alarm is at a future date
    - Emits 'AlarmNotSet' if time is not valid or if an alarm is already present
    - Sets the time to the RTC alarm if validation passes
    - Emits a `AlarmSet` event with the previous time if the alarm is set successfully
    - Emits a `AlarmNotSet` event if the alarm is not set successfully

#### `ALARM_CANCEL` Command Usage
1. A ground station sends a `ALARM_CANCEL` command with the desired alarm ID to cancel
2. On each command, the component:
    - Validates that an alarm exists
    - Emits 'AlarmNotCanceled' if an alarm is already present
    - Cancels the present alarm if it is present on the system
    - Emits a `AlarmCanceled` event with the previous time if the alarm is canceled successfully
    - Emits a `AlarmNotCanceled` event if the alarm is not canceled successfully

#### `ALARM_LIST` Command Usage
1. A ground station sends a `ALARM_LIST` command
2. On each command, the component:
    - Validates that an alarm exists
    - Emits 'AlarmNotSet' if no alarm is present
    - Emits 'AlarmSet' if an alarm is present and returns it's information to the ground station

#### `timeGetPort` Port Usage
1. The component is instantiated and initialized during system startup
2. In a deployment topology, a `time connection` relation is made to sync FPrime's internal clock
3. On each call, the component:
    - Returns uptime with the `TB_PROC_TIME` time base if the `TIMEBASE` parameter is `TB_PROC_TIME`
    - Checks if the RTC device is ready
    - If the RTC is ready:
        - Fetches time from the RTC hardware
        - Computes a rescaled microsecond value using the system cycle counter
        - Returns time with `TB_SC_TIME` time base
    - If the RTC is not ready (failover mode):
        - Logs a warning message (throttled to prevent console flooding)
        - Fetches monotonic uptime from the system
        - Computes a rescaled microsecond value using the system cycle counter
        - Returns time with `TB_PROC_TIME` time base (uptime since boot)
    - Uses an internal offset and modulo arithmetic to keep microseconds in `[0, 999_999]` while ensuring sub-second monotonicity for each time base

### Sub-second Monotonicity Behavior

To ensure that `Fw::Time` always has a valid, non-decreasing microsecond field:

- On the first call to the `timeGetPort` for any one second of time passed on the real time clock:
  - Captures microseconds since boot value derived from the hardware cycle counter
  - Stores this as `m_offset_useconds`
- For each subsequent `timeGetPort` call during the same second:
  - Reads the current microseconds since boot from the cycle counter
  - Forms an adjusted value `(current_useconds - m_offset_useconds)` and applies modulo `1_000_000`
  - Uses the result as the `useconds` field in `Fw::Time`

This guarantees:

- `0 <= useconds <= 999_999` for all returned times (satisfies `FW_ASSERT(useconds < 1000000, ...)`)
- No backward jumps in the sub-second field for a given time base, until natural wrap at one second

This logic applies both when using the RTC (`TB_SC_TIME`) and when in failover mode using uptime (`TB_PROC_TIME`).

## Sequence Diagrams

### `timeGetPort` port

The `timeGetPort` port is called from a `time connection` in a deployment topology to sync the RTC's time with FPrime's internal clock. The component automatically falls back to uptime if the RTC is unavailable. When the TimeBase parameter is TB_PROC_TIME it returns uptime without touching the RTC.
