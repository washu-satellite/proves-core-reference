# Components::ModeManager

The ModeManager component manages system operational modes and orchestrates transitions between NORMAL and SAFE_MODE. It evaluates voltage conditions and detects unintended reboots to make mode decisions, controls power to non-critical subsystems during transitions, and maintains/persists mode state across reboots.

## Requirements
| Name | Description | Method | Level | Pass Criteria | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|MM0001|The ModeManager shall maintain two operational modes: NORMAL and SAFE_MODE|Integration Test|Board|GET_CURRENT_MODE returns SAFE_MODE after FORCE_SAFE_MODE and NORMAL after EXIT_SAFE_MODE, each within 5 s|||
|MM0002|The ModeManager shall enter safe mode when commanded manually via FORCE_SAFE_MODE command|Integration Test|Board|FORCE_SAFE_MODE from NORMAL: ManualSafeModeEntry and EnteringSafeMode(Ground command) events within 2 s; GET_SAFE_MODE_REASON = GROUND_COMMAND|||
|MM0003|The ModeManager shall enter safe mode when requested by external components via forceSafeMode port|Integration Testing|||||
|MM0004|The ModeManager shall exit safe mode only via explicit EXIT_SAFE_MODE command or automatic voltage recovery|Integration Test|Board|In SAFE_MODE with reason GROUND_COMMAND no AutoSafeModeExit occurs within 13 s (debounce 10 s + 3); EXIT_SAFE_MODE returns to NORMAL within 5 s|||
|MM0005|The ModeManager shall turn off all 8 load switches when entering safe mode|Unit Test, Integration Test|Board|Unit: enterSafeMode calls loadSwitchTurnOff on all 8 connected ports exactly once; Board: every load switch reads OFF via GET_IS_ON within 5 s of FORCE_SAFE_MODE|||
|MM0006|The ModeManager shall turn on face load switches (0-5) when exiting safe mode; payload switches (6-7) remain off|Integration Testing|||||
|MM0007|The ModeManager shall persist mode state to non-volatile storage and restore on initialization|Integration Test|Board|After FORCE_SAFE_MODE then WARM_RESET, GET_CURRENT_MODE = SAFE_MODE and reason GROUND_COMMAND; no UnintendedRebootDetected event after a commanded reset|||
|MM0008|The ModeManager shall detect unintended reboots and enter safe mode with reason SYSTEM_FAULT|Integration Testing|||||
|MM0009|The ModeManager shall automatically enter safe mode when voltage drops below configurable threshold|Unit Test|Unit|Voltage < SafeModeEntryVoltage (6.7 V) or invalid on 10 consecutive run ticks enters SAFE_MODE with AutoSafeModeEntry(LOW_BATTERY); 9 ticks or a good sample in between does not|||
|MM0010|The ModeManager shall automatically exit safe mode (LOW_BATTERY only) when voltage recovers above configurable threshold|Unit Test|Unit|In SAFE_MODE(LOW_BATTERY) voltage > 8.0 V on 10 consecutive ticks exits with AutoSafeModeExit; exactly 8.0 V, 9 ticks, or reason GROUND_COMMAND/SYSTEM_FAULT does not|||
|MM0011|The ModeManager shall enter safe mode with reason COMMAND_LOSS if no authenticated packet is received within COMM_LOSS_TIME after the first packet|Integration Testing|||||

### Output Ports
| Name | Type | Description |

## Commands

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| FORCE_SAFE_MODE | Forces safe mode with reason GROUND_COMMAND |
| EXIT_SAFE_MODE | Exits safe mode (fails if not in safe mode) |

## Parameters

Voltage thresholds and command loss timeout are configurable via F-Prime parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| SafeModeEntryVoltage | F32 | 6.7 | Voltage (V) below which safe mode is entered |
| SafeModeRecoveryVoltage | F32 | 8.0 | Voltage (V) above which safe mode can be exited |
| SafeModeDebounceSeconds | U32 | 10 | Consecutive seconds required for transitions |
| COMM_LOSS_TIME | Fw.TimeIntervalValue | {seconds=3*60*60*24} | Time without an authenticated packet before command loss safe mode entry (default: 3 days) |

Parameters can be modified at runtime via `PRM_SET` commands.

## Events

| SafeModeEntryCount | U32 | Times safe mode entered (persists across reboots) |
| CurrentSafeModeReason | SafeModeReason | Current reason (NONE if not in safe mode) |

## State Persistence

State is persisted to `/mode_state.bin`:
- Current mode (U8)
- Safe mode entry count (U32)
- Safe mode reason (U8)
- Clean shutdown flag (U8)

## Safe Mode Reason Logic

| Reason | Trigger | Auto-Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| LOW_BATTERY | Voltage below threshold | Yes (when voltage recovers) |
| SYSTEM_FAULT | Unintended reboot detected | No |
| GROUND_COMMAND | FORCE_SAFE_MODE command | No |
| EXTERNAL_REQUEST | forceSafeMode port call or command loss timeout | No |

## Load Switch Mapping

| Index | Subsystem | NORMAL | SAFE_MODE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0-5 | Satellite Faces | ON | OFF |
| 6-7 | Payload Power/Battery | OFF | OFF |

> When exiting to NORMAL, only face switches (0-5) turn ON. Payload switches must be controlled separately.

## Design Notes

- **Hysteresis**: Entry threshold (6.7V) < Recovery threshold (8.0V) prevents oscillation
- **Debounce**: Configurable consecutive samples prevent spurious transitions
- **Reason tracking**: Only LOW_BATTERY allows auto-recovery; other reasons require manual EXIT_SAFE_MODE
- **Mode query**: Both pull (getMode) and push (modeChanged) patterns supported
- **Command loss ownership**: ProvesRouter signals `packetRouted` on each routed packet; ModeManager owns the timer and the mode transition, keeping routing and mode management as separate concerns
- **Command loss thread safety**: `m_commandLossStartTime` is protected by `m_commandLossMutex` since `packetRouted_handler` (called from the radio thread) and `run_handler` (called from the rate group thread) may run concurrently
